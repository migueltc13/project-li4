{\bfseries{Better\+Finds}} is built using the {\bfseries{ASP.\+NET}} framework and {\bfseries{C\#}} programming language.

It uses the {\bfseries{Razor Pages}} model, which is a page-\/based programming model that makes building web UI easier and more productive.

The {\bfseries{Better\+Finds}} project is organized into the following directories\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Pages\+:}} Contains the {\bfseries{Razor Pages}} that make up the {\bfseries{Better\+Finds}} website and their corresponding code-\/behind files.
\item {\bfseries{Utils\+:}} Contains utility classes used throughout the project.
\item {\bfseries{Services\+:}} Contains the asynchronous services used at the start of the application.
\item {\bfseries{Hub\+:}} Contains the {\bfseries{SignalR}} hub used for real-\/time updates.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_sec_run}{}\doxysection{How to Run}\label{index_sec_run}

You will also need to have a {\bfseries{MSSQL}} database server running on your machine. The database connection string can be configured in the {\ttfamily appsettings.\+json} file, located in the root directory of the {\bfseries{Better\+Finds}} project. Next you will need to configure the {\bfseries{MSSQL}} server by running the {\bfseries{T-\/\+SQL}} scripts located in the {\ttfamily sql} directory of the {\bfseries{Better\+Finds}} project.

To run the {\bfseries{Better\+Finds}} project locally from the source code, follow these steps\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Open a terminal or command prompt.
\item Navigate to the root directory of the {\ttfamily Better\+Finds} project.
\item Run the following command\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# Run from source}
\DoxyCodeLine{dotnet run -\/-\/environment Production}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# Alternatively, you can run from realease}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# Create a release build}
\DoxyCodeLine{dotnet publish -\/-\/configuration Release}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# Run the release build}
\DoxyCodeLine{dotnet bin/Release/net8.0/BetterFinds.dll}

\end{DoxyCode}
